# Configure the deployment mode. This means if the TraDE middleware is deployed and operated as a single node
# (mode=SINGLE_NODE) or as a connected network of multiple nodes using Hazelcast (mode=MULTI_NODE). In addition also
# a custom mode (mode=CUSTOM) can be specified. In this case users have to provide a list of corresponding references
# to classes which implement all required interfaces, e.g., IDataManager. We assume that the resulting implementation
# follows the singleton pattern using an enum with an 'INSTANCE' constant. The class SimpleDataManager.java can be
# used as a template for custom implementations.

# Configure which mode ('FILE', 'DB' or 'CUSTOM') should be used to persist the data. In custom mode users have to
# provide a corresponding implementation of the IPersistenceProvider interface. We assume that the resulting

# Configure which notification mode ('CAMEL' or 'CUSTOM') should be used to realize the management and execution of
# data-related notifications, e.g., inform an external client if a data value is initialized and therefore available
# to read. In custom mode users have to provide a corresponding implementation of the INotificationManager interface.
