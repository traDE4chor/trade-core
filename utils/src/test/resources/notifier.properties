# Comma-separated list of notifier id's for which an implementation is registered below. This list can be extended in
# order to add new notifier implementations to the middleware. Please do not add spaces or use any other delimiter
# characters than ",". For each of the notifier id's of the list at least a class property has to be specified below.
# All other properties are optional.
notifiers=activemq,http

# Configure the path on the filesystem where the notification message templates are stored. We assume that all files
# located in the specified directory are well-defined Apache Freemarker template files. More information on how to
# specify such template files can be found here: [http://freemarker.org/].
# Relative paths are resolved against the location (root path) of the middleware.

# The properties of the notifier implementations listed above ('notifiers'). For each notifier a class property
#'[notifierId].class' is mandatory any other predefined (e.g., 'messageTemplate') or custom properties are optional.

# ActiveMQ notifier
# The full-qualified class name of the ActiveMQ notifier implementation
activemq.class=org.trade.core.notifiers.provided.ActiveMQNotifierService
# Use the plain message template by default
activemq.messageTemplate=plainMsg.ftl

# HTTP notifier
# The full-qualified class name of the HTTP notifier implementation
http.class=org.trade.core.notifiers.provided.HttpNotifierService
# Use the JSON message template by default
http.messageTemplate=jsonMsg.ftl

# To provide additional or customize default notifier implementations the notifier list can be extended and/or adapted
# with new notifier implementations. The provided notifier implementations are using Apache Camel and are therefore
# only compatible with the provided CamelNotificationManager. If a custom notification manager is used which does not use
# Apache Camel the provided default notifier implementations have to be also replaced with classes that are
# compatible (i.e., use the same technology, framework, etc.) with the registered custom notification manager.
# We also support any additional custom properties which can be loaded from the corresponding notifier
#implementations through calling NotifierProperties#getCustomNotifierProperty(notifierId, customPropertyName).
# Find below an example for the registration of a new notifier implementation:
#notifier-id.class=fqn-class-name-of-notifier-implementation
#notifier-id.messageTemplate=/someCustomTemplate.ftl
#notifier-id.customProperty=someValue
#notifier-id.anotherCustomProperty=value
