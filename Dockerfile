#
# Build and run:
#
#   docker build -t trade4chor/trade-core .
# 
#   docker run --name trade-core -p 8081:8081 -d trade4chor/trade-core
#
# The container is running in the background and remains active until it is explicitly stopped by running:
# 
#   docker stop trade-core
#
# The middleware is by default configured to run with the local file system as persistence layer.
# Nevertheless, the complete middleware can be configured according to users' requirements and run time context
# through corresponding files located under 'config/'.
# To mount customized configuration files located on your host into a container, start a container with corresponding
# data volumes (one for the emitted logs and one for the customized configuration files) through the following command:
#
#   docker run --name trade-core -p 8081:8081 -d -v /abs_path_to_persistent_dir/logs:/opt/trade/logs -v /abs_path_to_persistent_dir/config:/opt/trade/config trade4chor/trade-core
#
# As an concrete example on a Windows host:
#   docker run --name trade-core -p 8081:8081 -d -v c:/trade-data/logs:/opt/trade/logs -v c:/trade-data/config:/opt/trade/config trade4chor/trade-core
# ... and on a Linux host:
#   docker run --name trade-core -p 8081:8081 -d -v /trade-data/logs:/opt/trade/logs -v /trade-data/config:/opt/trade/config trade4chor/trade-core
#
# Templates for all required configuration files can be downloaded from GitHub: https://github.com/traDE4chor/trade-core/tree/master/config.
# Please provide all files through the shared host directory in order to run the middleware correctly.
# Further details about mounting host directories as data volumes are provided here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume
# Don't forget to restart/recreate the trade-core container after changing the configuration so that the changes are applied.
#
# As an alternative option, a customized image can be build as provided by Dockerfile-db which uses MongoDB as
# persistence layer. To run both services, TraDE and MongoDB, a corresponding docker-compose.yml is provided as an example.
#

#
# Interactive access for debugging:
#
#   docker run --rm --name trade-core -p 8081:8081 -ti --entrypoint "/bin/bash" trade4chor/trade-core
#
# Inside the container, the TraDE middleware has to be started manually through "traDE". In order to be able to use
# the shell after the middleware is started, the following command allows running the middleware in the background:
#
#   nohup traDE &
#
